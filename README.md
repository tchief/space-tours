## What?
Chat bot for space travel agencies.

## Why?
1. Travel agency links theirs tours to a bot and can edit them keeping bot up to date.
2. Bot helps customer pick a tour and learn about existing tours and Solar system.

## How it works?
1. Tours in markdown, editable by travel agency.
2. Chat bot answers questions about tours and tries not to hallucinate, but to answer according to the tour descriptions.
3. Travel agency administrator can edit the tour description, add a new tour.
4. Tours got reindexed.
5. Bot uses new information for answers.

## Next steps?
1. Connect bot directly to NASA APIs (get up to date info about solar system, news from API).
2. All travel agencies could use the same bot, but setup theirs own different tours.
3. Thus all agencies would have up to date solar system info, and would not need to maintain it.
4. Other platforms (Discord, Slack, etc).
5. Authentication for travel agencies.
